# Tests

This folder contains some tests performed on the jsVectorMap APi in order to check how well it performed when dealing with big data sets. The tests included displaying many markers (above 1000), having information for all the available countries (240 currently) and having a big number of filters to select from (this was used for UX tests). The _result_ of these tests can be found on the live Examples.
